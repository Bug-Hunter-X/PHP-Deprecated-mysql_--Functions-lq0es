This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP code: the use of deprecated `mysql_*` functions.  These functions are no longer supported in PHP 7 and later versions, leading to errors and application failure. The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code using these deprecated functions. The solution in `bugSolution.php` shows how to replace them with the improved `mysqli_*` functions for secure database interaction.
